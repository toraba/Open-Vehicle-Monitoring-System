VDS Can bus Messages

CREDIT

; Thanks to Scott451 for figuring out many of the Roadster CAN bus messages used by the OVMS,
; and the pinout of the CAN bus socket in the Roadster.

; Thanks to fuzzylogic for further analysis and messages such as door status, unlock/lock, speed, VIN, etc.

; Thanks to markwj for further analysis and messages such as Trip, Odometer, TPMS, etc.

MESSAGES

Status messages to the VDS are sent on CAN ID # 0x100. The first byte (B1) is a sub_message index. The bitrate is 1Mbps.
A simplification of the messages you need and their interpretation is as follows:

Bytes are numbered B1 to B8 not B0-B7
bits are numbered bit0 to bit7
Byte pairs are in little endian order (e.g B4*256+B3)

Note: This is now the full list of messages seen on a 2011 Tesla Roadster 2.x, RHD. There are still quite a few
      messages whose function is unknown, and these should be consider 'target' for further analysis.

Here are some target information that should be on the bus, but are still unknown:

		0. TRIP -> odometer
		1. Direction (N, S, E, W, etc - as shown on VDS)       [ Got: MWJ Feb 2012 ]
		2. Ambient temperature                                 [ Got: MS Jan 2012 ]
		3. Other temperatures                                  [ Some got: MWJ Feb 2012 ]
		4. Battery voltages, current, balancing, etc
		5. Voltages and current on the different power lines
		6. Gear (P, R, N, D)

                N.B. Altitude is in metres, and may be negative. Car rounds to nearest 10m and has a floor of 0m.
                     Directions 0 and 360 are the same (North) - seems to be a bug in the car's VMS, so treat 360 as 0.

			Investigating:
			Car seems to suppress the id#100 B1=A3 temperature message until the TEMP screen is brought up.
			Tried to send the 102,06,D0,07,00,00,01,80,00 message, and that appeared to start id#100 B1=A3 temperature message transmission.

	Lock/Unlock
		B1=0x0B
		B2=	0x00 = Activate Valet mode
			0x01 = Deactivate Valet mode
			0x02 = Lock car
			0x03 = unlock car
			0x04 = PIN related (have to investigate more)
		B3=0x00
		B4=0x00
		B5= PIN LSB
		B6= PIN
		B7= PIN (total 28 bits for PIN)
		B8= PIN MSB	4 bits = number of PIN characters (1-8)
				4 LSB bits = PIN MSB

		N.B. example PIN 1234 unlock is 0x0B, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0xD2, 0X04, 0x00, 0x40
		N.B. unlock/lock does not affect the immobilizer+alarm (when fitted)

	Home Link
		B1=0x09
		B2=0x00
		B3=Homelink device (0x00, 0x01 or 0x02)

		N.B. mstegen is also seeing another message on the CAN bus just before this message, 0x09 0x02 0x00, not sure if it's important.
		     markwj suspects perhaps some sort of wakeup message.

	Lock/Unlock result
		B1=0x0E
		B2=result (0x04=locked, 0x05=unlocked)

	Sequence Notes:
		Some unusual behavior was noticed when trying to send a START CHARGE command to a sleeping car.
		The car got into a mode where the VDS said "Preparing to charge" and "CONNECT POWER CABLE" and charge would not start.
		Waking up the car (either VDS or pressing a door handle) would start the charge.
		It appears that with the car plugged in but not charging, the VMS (or some other part of the car) can go to sleep
		(signified by the cooling pump being off) while the VDS is still on. Sending the START CHARGE command in such a mode
		causes the problem. Observing the VDS behavior when starting a charge on a sleeping car we find:
			0ms   id#102 0x05, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
			150ms id#102 0A
		Sending id#102 B1=0x0A (a single byte message) on the bus indeed wakes up the car (pump starts).
		So, the sequence for START CHARGE should be:
			0ms   id#102 0x05, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
			150ms id#102 0x0A
		For STOP CHARGE, this should not be necessary (as the car should already be awake if it is charging).
