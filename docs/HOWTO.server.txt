HOWTO Setup an OVMS server
==========================


0. DO I NEED THIS?

You don't need to run your own OVMS server.
You can just use the public Open Vehicles OVMS server.
The choice is yours.


1. PREREQUISITES

You'll need a Linux. OSX, BSD, or other flavour of Unix, server with a public IP address and
a shell account able to setup a daemon listening on a port. You'll need a modern version of
perl running on that server, and a bunch of perl modules (from cpan).

You'll need a MYSQL server running on the same machine, or another machine, and credentials
to be able to create a database and accounts.

This could conscievably run on a windows server, but you are on your own ;-)
[ let us know instructions if you manage to get it running ]


2. MODULE INSTALLATION

Install the following perl modules from CPAN:

  Config::IniFiles
  Digest::MD5
  Digest::HMAC
  Crypt::RC4::XS
  MIME::Base64

  DBI
  DBD::mysql
  EV
  AnyEvent
  AnyEvent::HTTP
  AnyEvent::HTTPD
  HTTP::Parser::XS
  Data::UUID
  Email::MIME
  Email::Sender::Simple
  Net::SSLeay
  JSON::XS

Install modules using cpanminus:
  cpanm Config::IniFiles Digest::MD5 Digest::HMAC Crypt::RC4::XS MIME::Base64 \
    DBI DBD::mysql EV AnyEvent AnyEvent::HTTP AnyEvent::HTTPD HTTP::Parser::XS \
    Data::UUID Email::MIME Email::Sender::Simple Net::SSLeay JSON::XS


3. MYSQL SETUP

Create a mysql database "openvehicles" and use the ovms_server.sql script from github (server
directory) to create the necessary ovms_* tables. Create a mysql username and password with
access to the database.

Insert a record into the ovms_cars table, to give you access to your own car:

      vehicleid: DEMO
         owner: 1
       carpass: DEMO
      userpass: DEMO
   cryptscheme: 0
      v_ptoken: 
  v_lastupdate: 0000-00-00 00:00:00

Obviously, change the vehicleid, carpass and userpass as necessary. The only required fields are
vehicleid and carpass.


4. OVMS_SERVER ACCESS TO MYSQL

Create a file ovms_server.conf which defines the access to the mysql database:

  [db]
  path=DBI:mysql:database=openvehicles;host=127.0.0.1
  user=<mysqlusername>
  pass=<mysqlpassword>

If the host is remote, change the host= parameter to be the remote IP address. Use 127.0.0.1 for local.

Test the connection with:

  $ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u <mysqlusername> -p 
  Enter password: <mysqlpassword>
  Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

If you get "ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied", fix it before proceeding. The most likely cause
is a mistake in your mysql user grant rights.


5. RUN THE SERVER

Get the ovms_server.pl code from github and run it with:

  $ ./ovms_server.pl
